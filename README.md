*hatch-fancy-pypi-readme* is a [*Hatch*] metadata plugin for everyone who cares about the first impression of their project‚Äôs PyPI landing page.
It allows you to define your PyPI project description in terms of concatenated fragments that are based on **static strings**, **files**, and most importantly:
**parts of files** defined using **cut-off points** or **regular expressions**.

You want your PyPI readme to be the project readme, but without badges, followed by the license file, and the changelog section for *only the last* release?
You‚Äôve come to the right place!

> **Note**
> "PyPI project description", "PyPI landing page", and "PyPI readme" all refer to the same thing.
> In *setuptools* it‚Äôs called `long_description` and is the text shown on a project‚Äôs PyPI page.
> We refer to it as ‚Äúreadme‚Äù because that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs called in [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/)-based `pyproject.toml` files.


### Showcases

<!-- Please add your project in alphabetic order, except leave hatch-fancy-pypi-readme last. -->
- [*jsonschema*](https://pypi.org/project/jsonschema/) ([`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/blob/main/pyproject.toml))
- [*pytermgui*](https://pypi.org/project/pytermgui/) ([`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/bczsalba/pytermgui/blob/master/pyproject.toml))
- And finally of course [*hatch-fancy-pypi-readme* 22.2.0](https://pypi.org/project/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme/22.2.0/), before we had to stop dog-fooding ourselves to get a version out ([`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/hynek/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme/blob/61bfac7bc30040286c6fda0838ac918d94aabf6e/pyproject.toml#L48-L69)).

## Motivation

In the olden days of `setup.py` files, I‚Äôve taken advantage of the fact that I can write Python to have compelling PyPI readmes.

For example [this](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/blob/b3dfebe2e10b44437c4f97d788fb5220d790efd0/setup.py#L110-L124) is the code that gave me the PyPI readme for [*attrs* 22.1.0](https://pypi.org/project/attrs/22.1.0/).
Especially having a summary of the latest changes is something I‚Äôve found users to appreciate.

The move away from dynamic `setup.py` files to static `pyproject.toml` configurations is great, but it robbed me of being able to provide this service to my users.
I‚Äôve been able to add some dynamism using the wonderful [*Cog*](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/), but it‚Äôs a bit awkward and shouldn‚Äôt be the long-term solution.

The goal of this plugin is to be able to switch away from `setup.py` without compromising on the user experience and without needing third-party tools for configuration-file templating.

With [*Hatch*] we got a standards-based packaging library that offers exactly the plugin interface I needed.
Now *you* too can have fancy PyPI readmes ‚Äì just by adding a few lines of configuration to your `pyproject.toml`.

<!-- start docs -->

## Configuration

*hatch-fancy-pypi-readme* is, like [*Hatch*], configured in your project‚Äôs `pyproject.toml`.

First you have to add *hatch-fancy-pypi-readme* to your `[build-system]`:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling", "hatch-fancy-pypi-readme"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

Next, you must tell the build system that your readme is dynamic by adding it to the `project.dynamic` list:

```toml
[project]
# ...
dynamic = ["readme"]
```

> **Note**:
> Don‚Äôt forget to remove the old `readme` key!

Next, you must add a `[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.fancy-pypi-readme]` section.

Here, you **must** supply a `content-type`.
Currently, only `text/markdown` and `text/x-rst` are supported by PyPI.

```toml
[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.fancy-pypi-readme]
content-type = "text/markdown"
```


### Fragments

Finally, you also **must** supply an *array* of `fragments`.
A fragment is a piece of text that is appended to your readme in the order that it‚Äôs specified.

We recommend *TOML*‚Äôs [syntactic sugar for arrays of wrapping the array name in double brackets](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables) and will use it throughout this documentation.


#### Text

Text fragments consist of a single `text` key and are appended to the readme exactly as you specify them:

```toml
[[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.fancy-pypi-readme.fragments]]
text = "Fragment #1"

[[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.fancy-pypi-readme.fragments]]
text = "Fragment #2"
```

results in:

```
Fragment #1Fragment #2
```

Note that there‚Äôs no additional space or empty lines between fragments unless you specify them.


#### File

A file fragment reads a file specified by the `path` key and appends it:

```toml
[[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.fancy-pypi-readme.fragments]]
path = "AUTHORS.md"
```

Additionally it‚Äôs possible to cut away parts of the file before appending it:

- **`start-after`** cuts away everything before the string specified.
- **`end-before`** cuts away everything after.
- **`pattern`** takes a [*regular expression*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) and returns the first group from it (you probably want to make your capture group non-greedy by appending a question mark: `(.*?)`).
  Internally, it uses

  ```python
  re.search(pattern, whatever_is_left_after_slicing, re.DOTALL).group(1)
  ```

  to find it.

Both *Markdown* and *reST* have comments (`<!-- this is a Markdown comment -->` and `.. this is a reST comment`) that you can use for invisible markers:

```markdown
# Boring Header

<!-- cut after this -->

This is the *interesting* body!

<!-- but before this -->

Uninteresting Footer
```

together with:

```toml
[[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.fancy-pypi-readme.fragments]]
path = "path.md"
start-after = "<!-- cut after this -->\n\n"
end-before = "\n\n<!-- but before this -->"
pattern = "the (.*?) body"
```

would append:

```markdown
*interesting*
```

to your readme.

> **Note**
>
> - You can insert the same file **multiple times** ‚Äì each time a different part!
> - The order of the options in a fragment block does *not* matter.
>   They‚Äôre always executed in the same order:
>
>   1. `start-after`
>   2. `end-before`
>   3. `pattern`

For a complete example, please see our [example configuration][example-config].


## Substitutions

After a readme is assembled out of fragments, it's possible to run an arbitrary number of [regexp](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)-based substitutions over it:

```toml
[[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.fancy-pypi-readme.substitutions]]
pattern = "This is a (.*) that we'll replace later."
replacement = 'It was a '\1'!'
ignore-case = true  # optional; false by default
```

---

Substitutions are for instance useful for replacing relative links with absolute ones:

```toml
[[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.fancy-pypi-readme.substitutions]]
# Literal TOML strings (single quotes) need no escaping of backslashes.
pattern = '\[(.+?)\]\(((?!https?://)\S+?)\)'
replacement = '[\1](https://github.com/hynek/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme/tree/main\g<2>)'
```

or expanding GitHub issue/pull request IDs to links:

```toml
[[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.fancy-pypi-readme.substitutions]]
# Regular TOML strings (double quotes) do.
pattern = "#(\\d+)"
replacement = "[#\\1](https://github.com/hynek/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme/issues/\\1)"
```


## CLI Interface

For faster feedback loops, *hatch-fancy-pypi-readme* comes with a CLI interface that takes a `pyproject.toml` file as an argument and renders out the readme that would go into respective package.

Your can run it either as `hatch-fancy-pypi-readme` or `python -m hatch_fancy_pypi_readme`.
If you don‚Äôt pass an argument, it looks for a `pyproject.toml` in the current directory.
You can optionally pass a `-o` option to write the output into a file instead of to standard out.

Since *hatch-fancy-pypi-readme* is part of the isolated build system, it shouldn‚Äôt be installed along with your projects.
Therefore we recommend running it using [*pipx*](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):


```shell
pipx run hatch-fancy-pypi-readme
```

---

You can pipe the output into tools like [*rich-cli*](https://github.com/Textualize/rich-cli#markdown) or [*bat*](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) to verify your markup.

For example, if you run

```shell
$ pipx run hatch-fancy-pypi-readme | pipx run rich-cli --markdown --hyperlinks -
```

with our [example configuration][example-config], you will get the following output:

![rich-cli output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hynek/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme/main/rich-cli-out.svg)

> **Warning**
> While the execution model is somewhat different from the [*Hatch*]-Python packaging pipeline, it uses the same configuration validator and text renderer, so the fidelity should be high.
>
> It will **not** help you debug **packaging issues**, though.
>
> To verify your PyPI readme using the full packaging pipeline, check out my [*build-and-inspect-python-package*](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package) GitHub Action.
