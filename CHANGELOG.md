## [22.3.0](https://github.com/hynek/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme/compare/22.2.0...22.3.0) - 2022-08-06

### Added

- Support for Python 3.7.
  While our Python version only applies when building a package, a package is built whenever it is installed.
  This includes *tox* environments.
  *hatch-fancy-pypi-readme* will always *at least* support the same Python version as the latest version of *Hatchling* â€“ *Hatch*'s build backend â€“ does.

  To get this version out, we had to stop dog-fooding *hatch-fancy-pypi-readme*. ðŸ˜¢


## [22.2.0](https://github.com/hynek/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme/compare/22.1.0...22.2.0) - 2022-08-05

### Changed

- We can finally use *hatch-fancy-pypi-readme* for our own âœ¨fancyâœ¨ PyPI readme!


### Fixed

- Hopefully fixed readmes with emojis on Windows.


## [22.1.0](https://github.com/hynek/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme/tree/22.1.0) - 2022-08-05

### Added

- Initial release.
